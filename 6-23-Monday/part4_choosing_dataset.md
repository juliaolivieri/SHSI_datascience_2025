## Part 4: Choosing a project dataset

Where to look for datasets:

1. Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
1. FiveThirtyEight (https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)
1. The UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

More sites that collect data are available here: https://www.interviewqs.com/blog/free-online-data-sets. I also recommend googling for datasets on your own, especially if you have a specific topic youâ€™re interested in.
